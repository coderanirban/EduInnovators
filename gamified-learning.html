                <h3>Engaging Quests and Challenges</h3>
                <p>Courses are broken down into quests, each with clear objectives, rewards, and progress tracking. For example, completing a math module could be a quest where students earn points, badges, or virtual rewards. Quests can be collaborative (team-based) or individual, promoting both independent learning and teamwork.</p>

                <h3>Achievement Badges and Rewards</h3>
                <p>Students earn badges and points for completing tasks, participating in class, or achieving milestones. These could be tied to both academic achievements and positive mental health practices (e.g., completing a meditation session).</p>

                <h3>Leveling System</h3>
                <p>As students progress, they can level up, unlocking new content, tools, or customization options for their profiles, which keeps them motivated to continue learning.</p>
